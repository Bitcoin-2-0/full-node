Bitcoin 2.0 was started by the Bitcoin 2.0 team as an ERC-20 token. 
This has significant limitations. As I received Bitcoin 2.0 tokens for listening it on my exchange. 
I want to make the coin a success by continuing on it's mission. 

The coin with use Proof of Stake (POS) rather than Proof of Work (POW). 
This it ensure that the coin doesn't contribute to CO2. 

The goal will be also to have the network be able to process 100,000 layer 1 transactions per second.
